    <h1>Welcome to Your Dashboard</h1>

    <p>
        As a Programme Coordinator, your role is key in ensuring smooth and accurate claim approvals.
        Here you can review submissions from lecturers, check supporting documents,
        and pre-approve claims before they are sent for the final review by the Academic Manager.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use this dashboard to stay organized, track pending approvals, and maintain transparency in the claiming process.
        Your input helps speed up processing times and ensures lecturers are fairly compensated for their work.
