    <h1>Welcome to Your Dashboard</h1>

    <p>
        As the Academic Manager, your role is vital in providing final oversight for claim approvals.
        Here you can review the Programme Coordinators’ pre-approved submissions, verify supporting documents,
        and make the final decision on each claim to ensure accuracy and compliance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use this dashboard to monitor the overall approval process, track claims at different stages,
        and uphold fairness in compensating lecturers. Your review helps maintain accountability
        and ensures that only valid claims are processed.
